AJANRO - A Pseudocode programming language designed by Professor Madras in collaboration
with Tiffany, Andrew, and Robert.

# SS-AJANRO - A (crude) translator for AJANRO written in C++ out of spite. 
This translator makes multiple assumptions regarding I/O, being:

- That the input comes from the console.
- That the output goes to the console.
- While there are features for File I/O in AJANRO, they won't be implemented
		for now.


# How to Build


Compilation requires [premake5](premake.github.io) for build files.
	Check the premake5 documentation [here](https://premake.github.io/docs/using-premake)
